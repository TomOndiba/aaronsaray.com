![](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-b3XXNMAL._SL110_.jpg)I just finished glancing over [Real-World Solutions for Developing High-Quality PHP Frameworks and Applications.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470872497/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0470872497&linkCode=as2&tag=aarsar-20)  I gotta say it...

**Finally!**

This is the book I wish I had years ago.  This is the book I wish I had written.  Go [buy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470872497/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0470872497&linkCode=as2&tag=aarsar-20) this book.

But let me break it down why I like it...





  * It covers foundations of quality software and testing


  * It talks about best practices using companies YOU know


  * It talks about testing things that we don't normally think through: front end, user acceptance, service layer API, and more


  * It has a lot of realworld thoughts



It basically went through a lot of the things that a mid level PHP programmer needs to learn.  From proper architecture, testing, planning, and even talk about the risks of Technical Debt, this book had it all.  I think it's a great addition to anyone's bookshelf.
