One of the biggest internal battles I have is whether to host my email locally on my 16mb/2mb network, source it out to the web host, or use a specialized webmail company.  I like that feeling of control, the fact that I know I could set up any anti spam and virus filtering service I wanted if I fully controlled my e-mail.  However, if my internet service goes down, or I have a power outage, no email!  I've always liked to tinker with my own servers as well - but I think getting a full rack mount solution is just outside of my budget. ;)



#### Solution for Small to Medium sized Businesses


Enter Perimetec.  Perimetec's combination of products and services was one of the main reasons why I spent so much time on their site when I first visited it.  First off, their [Email Spam Blocker](http://www.perimetec.com/Services.php) service looks pretty cool.  For **$2.50 a month** per mailbox, I can get usage of this service -basically an account on their Barracuda appliance.  (Looks like you can get a discount if you sign up for a year.)  Not only will this provide me with top of the line spam filtering, it will even queue email if my service goes down.  (Hrm... Maybe I should start looking at that whole closet set up I have again... can that old 450mhz box handle my mail load?).  Add-ons to the service include DNS management and Webmail.



#### Products for those with their own systems


If you're more on the ball than I am, and have everything all set to go in your closet/computer room/server farm, then check out Perimetec's [Barracuda Anti Spam](http://www.perimetec.com/Products.php) products.  Touting what appears to be the full line of Barracuda products, it looks like Perimetec's in a good place to offer good deals on their line.



#### What would I do?


Lets be honest - free trials are awesome - but they're usually short.  Too short.  Perhaps you've not even had a chance to use a Barracuda product before either.  Whether you're just a small business or looking to get your own system, sign up for the service first.  For $2.50 a month on an email account, you can check out the type of service your own appliance will give you.  Then, when you're ready to take beef up your [Email Spam Protection](http://www.perimetec.com/AboutPerimetec.php), definitely consider upgrading with Perimetec.
