I received a set of cards from [meetmeme.com](http://meetmeme.com).  In addition to my cards, they also provide the following URL:
[http://mtme.me/c89ab](http://mtme.me/c89ab)

I thought this was a pretty cool idea but with two problems:
a) My tweet count was wayyyy off when I got the cards.  There is no way I only had like 4 or 11 tweets...
b) I just found them really hard to fit in my wallet.  They are the size of baseball playing cards - which is by design - but they're hard to carry around.
