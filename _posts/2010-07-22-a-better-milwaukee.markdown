I know - this is a bit non standard of a blog post for me... but bear with me. :)

A fellow kayaker took this picture of Milwaukee.

I thought it could look a little better.

I've also attached the [PSD file](http://aaronsaray.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/mkepsd.psd).  If you have any suggestions on how I could have done this better/faster, please let me know. :)  I'm still trying to learn how to touch up photos better.
