The goal was to use links that Amazon provided themselves to showcase categories and percentage discounts with my affiliate tag.  The thought was a clean interface would easily encourage people to click a discount of say 90% but send affiliate contributions my way.

Technical items:
- as usual, I deflated and set 1 year expirations on items.  I also used a single sprite image for each individual icon for the categories on the left hand side reducing HTTP requests.

Lessons Learned:
- It may be a very simple design, but users don't browse amazon that much.  They search for what they want.  So discounts of random things aren't that useful.
- No real text on the page means Google isn't that keen to index it as a top result.
