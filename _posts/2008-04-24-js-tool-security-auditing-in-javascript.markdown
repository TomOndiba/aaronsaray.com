![](http://aaronsaray.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/jstool-112x150.gif)JSTool was a trial run of combining many different scripts from the open source community into a security and auditing script.  Features             would include history viewing, website status reporting and port scanning.             Very little original code - just combinations of existing code.  Check             the comments for proper author attribution.  This script really isn't             in working condition for production distribution.  Download it and              learn from it.
