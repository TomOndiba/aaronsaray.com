## Writing Standards

I'm either way too anal - or this is just because I forget things. You get to decide!

### Entries

All entries, when using headers, should start with h4 (####) and only go as deep as h5 (#####).

Code will be highlighted using the fluid syntax and highlighter plugin for Jekyll as such:

    {% highlight CSS %}
    Some code here
    {% endhighlight %}
    
Where CSS can be any supported language.  The initial indent of the code should be no spaces.
