If you're looking for the abridged version, ie, [the resume](/resume) this is not it! :)  Instead, this CV contains my professional history since 2001.

### Open Source

The preeminent showcase of Open Source Software is GitHub.  You can find my repositories at [github.com/aaronsaray](https://github.com/aaronsaray).  

At GitHub, I've released various PHP and Javascript code including [FirePHP4Chrome](https://github.com/aaronsaray/FirePHP4Chrome), [jQuery Accordion Live Filter](https://github.com/aaronsaray/jquery-accordion-live-filter), and [MadMimi PHP API](https://github.com/aaronsaray/madmimi-api-php).  With over 20 public repositories, I am committed (PUN!) to OSS.

### Publications

I am a prolific author, editor and blogger.  (Yes, blogger! On this site - [400+ technical and business entries](/blog) since 2007.)

#### Author

[33 Things I Wish Somebody Would Have Told Me](http://33thingsbook.com/) This book details - you guessed it - 33 things that I wish someone would have mentioned to be before or during my programming and management career.  A more conversational read, this shares lessons I've learned "the hard way" in a language or technical disipline-agnostic format.

[WROX: Professional PHP Design Patterns](http://saray.me/look-at-this-guy) (ISBN: 978-0470496701) This book helps bridge the guide between the traditional design pattern books and the average PHP developer.  Learn how to apply all the true, time-tested patterns in object-oriented PHP.

The Confident Coder.  A monthly column for PHP[architect] from [October, 2013](https://www.phparch.com/magazine/2013-2/october/) to [September, 2014](https://www.phparch.com/magazine/2014-2/september/).  From best practice programming tips to communication skills for programmers, this column was a staple for 12 issues of PHP[architect], the leading PHP magazine.

[Columnist for the PHP channel of SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/author/asaray/) Previously known as PHPMaster.com, the SitePoint PHP channel contains high quality content from noted PHP experts.  I wrote two articles: Debugging PHP Code with FirePHP and Giving Your First PHP Presentation.

MKE PHP: Best People, Best Practices.  This article for PHP[architect] was co-authored by me in 2012.  In it, my writing partner and I explained the challenges and rewards of starting Milwaukee's first PHP user group.
